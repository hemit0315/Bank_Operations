Problem Statement: Banking System Using Classes and Objects in C++ 
Objective: Create a Banking System in C++ Programming that uses classes 
and objects. The program should allow users to register, log in, and perform 
basic banking operations like viewing account details, withdrawing, and 
depositing money. 
Requirements: 
1. Class BankAccount: 
o The class should contain the following private members: 
▪ username (string), email (string), phone (string), age (int), 
balance (double), password (string), accountType (string). 
o The class should have the following public member functions: 
▪ setDetails(): Takes all user details as input and sets the 
account details. 
▪ viewAccountDetails(): Displays the account details such as 
username, email, phone number, account type, and current 
balance. 
▪ withdraw(): Allows the user to withdraw money from their 
account. The function should check whether the user has 
sufficient balance after deducting the minimum balance 
based on their age. 
▪ deposit(): Allows the user to deposit money into their 
account, ensuring the deposit amount matches the number 
of notes entered. 
▪ authenticate(): Compares the username and password for 
authentication. 
2. Class BankSystem: 
o This class manages user registration and login and provides a 
menu-driven interface for banking operations. 
o The first screen should show a welcome message and ask the user 
to register by entering a username, email, phone, age, and 
password. 
o The system should check if the username contains spaces. If it 
does, prompt the user to enter a valid username. 
o After successful registration, the details (username and 
password) should be saved to a file login.dat. 

o The user can log in using their registered username and 
password. 
o Once logged in, the user should have the following options: 
▪ View account details. 
▪ Withdraw money (with minimum balance requirements 
based on age). 
▪ Deposit money. 
▪ Exit. 
Functionality Breakdown: 
1. Registration: 
o The user provides their username, email, phone, age, and 
password. Ensure that the username contains no spaces. 
o Save the user's login credentials to login.dat. 
2. Login: 
o The user logs in with their username and password. The system 
verifies the credentials by reading from login.dat. 
3. Account Operations: 
o View Account Details: The user can view their account details 
including username, email, phone number, account type, and 
current balance. 
o Withdraw Money: The system checks if the user has enough 
balance considering the minimum balance required based on age, 
and processes the withdrawal. 
o Deposit Money: The system allows the user to deposit money by 
specifying the number of notes of denominations 100, 200, 500, 
and 2000, and verifies if the total amount matches the input
